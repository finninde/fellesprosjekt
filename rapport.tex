\section{Resources}
We have 6 persons available for completing the application. Every person has their own personal computer with 
development tools for the \href{java runtime environment}{TODO:link}, the \href{PostgreSQL}{TODO:link} database, 
and the \href{JSON}{TODO link} object interface.
We do not intend to spend any money on this project. 

\section{Time and budget estimate}
Based on the resources we have at our disposal we have made the following time and budget estimates. In addition to creating a calendar, we have also been given a separate project in TTM4100 which we have included here.
\subsection{Time estimate}
We have estimated 18 workdays of 8 hours, with 6 developers. This gives us $864$ work hours.


\subsection{Budget estimate}
We have estimated a total monetary spending budget of 0 NOK, because we are using free software and the developers personal computers. It is highly unlikely that we will pay for any new software or hardware during this project. 

\section{Deadlines}
The absolute deadlines are required from our customer(the exercise).

\section{Responsibilities}
We will divide the responsibility for the completion of the exercise in 4 parts; the database, network communication, 
client model and client view. 
\subsection{Database}

\subsection{Network communication}

KTN Separate project

	Extra functionality 0-24
Extra testing:4
	Many clients 4
Total: 38

KTN Common project:
Implementation and testing: 60.
	Communication between Server and clients 30
		Send JSON objects to client logged in client. 
        and retrieve them from the database
		
	Communication between clients and server passing JSON objects: 30
		Create error if inconsistency and send back to client. 
        and add them to the database if consistent
Total: 60

98 hours overall.
