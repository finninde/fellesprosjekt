\section{Resources}
We have 6 persons available for completing the application. Every person has their own personal computer with 
development tools for the \href{java runtime environment}{TODO:link}, the \href{PostgreSQL}{TODO:link} database, 
and the \href{JSON}{TODO link} object interface.
We do not intend to spend any money on this project. 

\section{Time and budget estimate}
Based on the resources we have at our disposal we have made the following time and budget estimates. In addition to creating a calendar, we have also been given a separate project in TTM4100 which we have included here.
\subsection{Time estimate}
We have estimated 18 workdays of 8 hours, with 6 developers. This gives us $864$ work hours.


\subsection{Budget estimate}
We have estimated a total monetary spending budget of 0 NOK, because we are using free software and the developers personal computers. It is highly unlikely that we will pay for any new software or hardware during this project. 

\section{Deadlines}
The absolute deadlines are required from our customer(the exercise).

\section{Responsibilities}
We will divide the responsibility for the completion of the exercise in 4 parts; the database, network communication, 
client model and client view. 
\subsection{Database}
The database will hold every piece of information that the program needs to save over a longer time period. 


The database section of the program will be divided as follows and the time estimates will be:

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{center}
    \caption{Database section and amount of time} 
    \label{database}

        $Task$ & $Estimated hours$\\
        \hline 
    Create ER-diagram for the application & 10 hours\\
    Logic databasechema & 10 hours\\    
    Setup the database server & 8 hours\\
    Create the needed structure in SQL & 16 hours\\
    Implement JDBC & 8 hours\\
    Implement needed methods & 16 hours\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

Total estimated time for implementation of the basic database features will be 68 hours.
