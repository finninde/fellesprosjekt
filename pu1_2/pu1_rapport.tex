\section{Resources}
We have 6 persons available for completing the application. Every person has their own personal computer with  development tools for the \href{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jre-7-download-432155.html}{java runtime environment}, the \href{http://www.postgresql.org/}{postgreSQL} database, 
and the \href{http://json.org/}{JSON} object interface.
The budget for our project is limited to the work hours specified in time estimate.

\section{Time and budget estimate}
Based on the resources we have at our disposal we have made the following time and budget estimates.
Since this project is a school exercise labour is free. Nonetheless we have put together a budget consisting of our work hours and a fictive salary of $849,90 NOK$. Making the salary budget a total of $\approx 734300 NOK$. In addition to creating a calendar, we have also been given a separate project in TTM4100 which we have included here, and will take some of the total work time.
We have estimated a total monetary spending budget of 0 NOK, because we are using free software and the developers personal computers. It is highly unlikely that we will pay for any new software or hardware during this project. 

We have estimated 18 workdays of 8 hours, with 6 developers. This gives us $864$ work hours.

\section{Deadlines}
The absolute deadlines are required from our customer(the exercise) are shown in table \ref{deadline}.

\begin{table}[h!]

\end{table}



\section{Responsibilities}
We will divide the responsibility for the completion of the exercise in 4 parts; the database, network communication, client model and client view.  There is also a person responsible for human resources, and a union representative chosen democratically by the group. The human resource responsible has taken on him to create a friendly work environment and to plan fun excursions.

\subsection{Database}
The database will hold every piece of information that the program needs to save over a longer time period. The work is divided as shown in table \ref{database}


\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}
    \caption{Database section and amount of time} 
    \label{database}
    \vspace{0,5cm}
    \begin{tabular}{ll} \\ 
        \hline
        $Task$ & $Estimated hours$\\
        \hline 
    Create ER-diagram for the application & 10 hours\\
    Logic databasechema & 10 hours\\    
    Setup the database server & 8 hours\\
    Create the needed structure in SQL & 16 hours\\
    Implement JDBC & 8 hours\\
    Implement needed methods & 16 hours\\
    \hline 
    Total & 68 hours \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Network communication}
Network communication consists of the part of the server communicating with both clients and the database. It is vital that the server can lock resources, and still queue requests from clients. In table \ref{Network} we have a look at how many work hours that will be allocated to this part of the system.

\subsection{Network communication}
\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}
    \caption{Computer networking work breakdown schedule}
    \label{Network}
    \vspace{0,5cm}
    \begin{tabular}{ll} \\
        \hline
        $Task$  & $Estimated hours$ \\
        \hline

\hline

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}


\subsection{Client model}
The client model can be separated in to several smaller problems that are easier time estimated as parts. The sum of these makes the total time estimate of the clients model as seen in table \ref{clientmodel}. The model will be written in java, and handle json objects from the server. It will also provide a fully fledged API for the GUI\footnote{graphical unit inteface}. 

 \begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}
    \caption{Client model time estimate} 
    \label{clientmodel}
    \vspace{0,5cm}
    \begin{tabular}{ll} \\ 
        \hline
        Task & Estimated hours\\
        \hline 
    Creating login functionality & 7 \\
    Parsing json objects to model & 8 \\
    Define model and API structure  & 12\\
    Create json objects based on the model & 8 \\
    Creating vital functions and objects & 16 \\
    Create unit tests & 6 \\
    Optimize the notify function & 15 \\    
        \hline
    Sum & 72\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}



\subsection{Client view}
The client view is the way the user interacts with the system. It features an easy to use interface communicating with the clients model. The workload is shown in table \ref{UI}.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}
    \caption{Time to design the user interface} 
    \label{UI}
    \vspace{0,5cm}
    \begin{tabular}{ll} \\ 
        \hline
        $Task$ & $Estimated hours$\\
        \hline

        \hline
    \end{tabular}

\end{table}
\section{Work load distribution as gantt diagram}
We are planning on rotating the tasks between people. The persons responsible are listed in table \ref{responsible}.
\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{center}
    \caption{Responsibilities} 
    \label{responsible}
    \vspace{0,5cm}
    \begin{tabular}{ll} \\ 
        \hline
        $Person$ & $Responsibilities$\\
        \hline 
        Espen Albert & Network communication\\
        Finn Inderhaug Holme & Client model\\
        Kristoffer Kradalby & Database \\
        Jonas Andr√© Dalseth & Client ciew, human resources \\
        Andreas Wien & Union represntative\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}
Espen is responsible for the KTN separate project. He will be rotating between the KTN project and the other projects. He will take turns working with different parts of the project for example

\begin{itemize}
\item monday: KTN with Jonas.
\item tuesday: GUI with Jonas. 
\item wednesday: KTN with Kristoffer. 
\item thursday: Database with kristoffer. 
\end{itemize}
The documentation will be an ongoing project since day one. We will log hours and do documentation all the way. The work load is shown in figure \ref{gantt}

\section{Risk analysis}
Our simple risk analysis is shown in figure \ref{risk}. The overall workload distribution is way below the $860$ hours. We have accounted for pretty much everything not going as planned.
