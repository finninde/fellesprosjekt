We are planning on rotating the tasks between people. This is why we only set up who is the project responsible in the gantdiagram. \
E.g. Espen is responsible for the KTN separate project. He will be rotating between this and the other projects;\
monday: KTN with Jonas. tuesday: GUI with Jonas. Wednesday: KTN with Kristoffer. Thursday: Database with kristoffer. \
\
The documentation will be an ongoing project since day one. We will log hours and do documentation all the way.t}
